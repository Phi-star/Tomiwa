    <h2>Unforgettable Moments 😍</h2>
    <p class="memory-text">
        Do you remember the day you told Emma that I look like an owl? 🤦‍♀️😂  
        That moment still makes me smile. You said it so playfully, like you were teasing me,  
        and I could just imagine the look on your face. That bird with two big eyes 👀—  
        that’s what you compared me to.
    </p>

    <p class="memory-text">
        But you know what? I don’t regret anything about that day.  
        In fact, I don’t regret knowing you at all. If I could go back in time,  
        I would still choose you, again and again. Because you, my love,  
        are my dream girl 💖✨. The one my heart beats for. 💘
    </p>

    <p class="memory-text">
        Every moment with you, even from a distance, is precious to me.  
        You are my joy, my peace, my everything. 💕 No matter where life takes us,  
        one thing will never change—I love you, and I always will. ❤️🥰

    <h2>The Tree of Love 🌳💞</h2>
    <p>
        I remember the tree of love named by Nana 😂 like it was yesterday.  
        The moments we shared together, the laughter, the little secrets,  
        the way everything felt so simple and beautiful. 💫
    </p>

    <p>
        We never really talked about it, but I still feel it deep inside.  
        The way we walked together, side by side, step by step. 🚶‍♂️🚶‍♀️  
        The way we moved as if we understood each other without words.  
        The way we talked, sometimes about nothing, yet it meant everything. 💕
    </p>

    <p>
        Those moments are treasures in my heart. No matter how far we are now,  
        they stay with me. And you, my love, you are the most precious part of it all. 💖

    <h2>My Forever Love ❤️</h2>

        I might not be there this Valentine’s Day, but I just want you to know  
        how much I really love you. No matter the distance, no matter the time,  
        my heart is always with you. 💞

    <p class="memory">
        Do you remember the first Valentine gift I gave you?  
        A drawing of a guy and a girl with love. 🎨💕  
        I don’t need to remember because I know that moment is still in your heart,  
        just like you are always in mine.
    </p>

    <p>
        That little drawing wasn’t just a gift; it was a piece of my heart,  
        a piece of my love for you. And even now, that love has only grown stronger. 💖  
        No matter where life takes us, one thing will never change—  
        I love you, and I always will. 💘
